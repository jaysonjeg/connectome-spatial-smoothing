# connectome-based-smoothing

Here, you may find the Python codes and sample scripts for connectome-based smoothing (CBS).

For more information you may check our article on **Connectome-Based Smoothing (CBS): Concepts, methods and evaluation** (currently under review). All resources are provided as complementary to the following article:

The codes in this repository mainly perform the following tasks:

- Map high-resolution structural connectomes from tractography

- Map atlas-resolution structural connectomes from tractography

- Compute the CBS smoothing kernel with selected parameters

- Perform CBS on high-resolution connectomes

- Perform CBS directly on atlas connectomes
